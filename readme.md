# TrickyUnits for C++

This is just a collection of the quick "Units" I've set up for my work in C++. Please note, I've set everything with the use of Visual Studio 2019 in mind. That being said it is also possible that some references exist to libraries 
only provided by VC2019. It's up to you if these libraries have any use to you or not, I only created them to make my own life easier and not to have to re-invent the wheel over the most trivial issues for every project I produce. 
None of them were meant for any serious distribution, but hey, if you have a use for them, go ahead, I won't stop you.

All units have been released under the terms of the zlib license UNLESS EXPLICITLY STATED OTHERWISE IN THE LICENSE BLOCK OF THE UNIT.

The source code of the units themselves can be found in "Source" and their header files in "Headers", but I guess all that is obvious. 

All, and er... that's all folks!
